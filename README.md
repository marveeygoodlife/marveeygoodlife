# ABOUT THE AUTHOR
## MARVELLOUS EDIAGBONYA

> I am  an International Relation undergraduate with a growing passion for website development.  
While studying diplomacy and global affairs, I have taken the initiative to build practical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating several small projects and personal portfolio  websites.  
I bring a unique perspective, combining an understanding of international dynamics with tech proficiency.  
I am looking to gain experience in roles where I can leverage both my academic knowledge and my web development skills to support innovative projects.
